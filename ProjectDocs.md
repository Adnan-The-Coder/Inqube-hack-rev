Integrates drone delivery for hard-to-reach areas.

Dynamic Inventory Tracking:
Uses IoT-enabled devices to track resources in real time.
Prevents overstocking or understocking at relief centers with predictive resupply alerts.

Risk Assessment Reports:
Generates detailed, localized reports on the impact of the crisis, such as potential economic damage, infrastructure risks, and health concerns.

10. Community Peer Support Network:
Connects users in affected regions with others who have faced similar crises to share experiences, advice, and emotional support.
11. Integration with Smart Devices and Wearables
Wearable Panic Buttons:
Connects to the platform and sends SOS signals with GPS location for faster response.

Problem-Solving Potential:
Enhanced Lives Saved Through Early Detection:
Reduces response times with early warning systems, potentially saving thousands of lives in high-risk situations like floods, pandemics, or earthquakes.
Optimized Resource Utilization:
AI-driven resource allocation and inventory tracking prevent wastage while ensuring that critical aid reaches those in need promptly.
Improved Crisis Coordination:
Breaks down silos among responders by offering a unified platform for communication and action, minimizing redundancy and confusion.
Economic and Infrastructure Resilience:
Post-crisis analytics and recovery planning help rebuild communities efficiently, reducing long-term economic losses and restoring critical infrastructure.
Empowered Communities:
Builds self-reliant communities that can prepare, respond, and recover effectively from crises, lessening the burden on governmental and international aid organizations.
Psychosocial Support:
Addresses often-overlooked mental health needs by connecting survivors with peer networks and virtual counselors, fostering quicker emotional recovery.
Universal Accessibility:
Multilingual support and accessibility features ensure the platform is usable by diverse populations, including individuals with disabilities or limited digital literacy.

2) 1. Background. UIDAI has multiple portals on the Internet for resident engagement and back office operations. These portals are protected with CAPTCHA for denial of service- related attacks. UIDAI believes that CAPTCHA is a barrier to smooth resident engagement with the aadhaar portals and therefore intends to remove it soon. Instead of active CAPTCHA, UIDAI is looking for a passive solution that can differentiate between a bot and a human operator. 2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to develop a solution, mostly following a passive approach through collection of environmental parameters and using AI/ML to analyze it in the backend to differentiate between bot and human-being. The passive solution may capture environmental details through the browser context and analyze the same with the help of ML models deployed in the backend. This solution, once accepted would be used by the UIDAI to protect all backend APIs from DoS/DDoS based vulnerabilities. The solution must meet the following requirements:- 3. The proposed solution must meet the following objectives. 3.1 Feature Requirements. The solution must define the list of environmental parameters that need to be captured to differentiate between a bot and a human being. If passive parameter analysis is unable to differentiate, then the user may be asked to do a few minimal interactions with the portal. User experience is important to UIDAI and hence human interaction is to be limited. 3.2 Frontend code to capture environmental or human interaction data must be compliant with the javascript framework. Participating teams may choose to use any framework like React/TypeScript/Flutter to demonstrate the solution. 3.3 As part of the solution, the required backend ML model to analyze the front- end capture of environment parameters or human interaction data must be developed to demonstrate the solution. 5. Expected Solution. The solution must be complete with both frontend and backend design, corresponding code and ML model to demonstrate the solution.

To differentiate between human users and bots, the system should capture and analyze the following environmental parameters:
